# ChatGPT Responses to Example Code

## Structured Prompt

Prompt: "Explain the purpose, inputs, outputs, and step-by-step logic of this code."

Response:

    Purpose:
        Defines and trains a simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer.
        Implements a training loop for 10 epochs using randomly generated data.
    Inputs:
        input_size: Number of features for each input (10).
        hidden_size: Number of neurons in the hidden layer (20).
        output_size: Number of output features (1).
    Outputs:
        Prints the loss at each epoch during training.
    Step-by-Step Logic:
        Defines a neural network class with an input layer, hidden layer, and output layer.
        Initializes the loss function (Mean Squared Error) and optimizer (Stochastic Gradient Descent).
        Generates random data for inputs and targets.
        Runs a forward pass to compute predictions.
        Computes the loss and performs a backward pass to update weights.
        Repeats this process for 10 epochs, printing the loss after each epoch.

Observation:

    ChatGPT provided a detailed explanation of the code, clearly breaking it into components.
    The structured prompt resulted in a step-by-step breakdown, ideal for understanding the flow.

## Direct Prompt:

Prompt: "What does this code do?"

Response:

    "This code defines and trains a simple feedforward neural network. It runs a training loop for 10 epochs, printing the loss at each step."

Observation:

    The response is accurate but lacks depth.
    ChatGPT summarized the functionality without explaining inputs, outputs, or logic.

## Open-Ended Prompt:

Prompt: "Help me understand this code."

Response:

    "This code implements a neural network model and trains it using randomly generated data. The training process involves multiple epochs and prints the loss during each step."

## Observations:

    The response is vague and doesnâ€™t address details like architecture or step-by-step logic.
    Best suited for beginners needing a quick overview.

Comparison Table:
Prompt Type Clarity (%) Accuracy (%) Depth (%)
Structured Prompt 90% 85% 80%
Direct Prompt 70% 75% 50%
Open-Ended Prompt 60% 65% 40%

## Summary:

    Structured prompts yielded the most useful and actionable insights, suitable for detailed understanding and debugging.
    Direct prompts were concise but often lacked the depth required for practical use.
    Open-ended prompts offered generic overviews, which may benefit beginners but are less practical for advanced users.
