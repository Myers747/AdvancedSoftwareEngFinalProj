# Project Report

## Introduction
- Problem: Understanding complex code is challenging.
- Solution: Optimize prompts to maximize ChatGPT’s explanatory power.

## Methods
- Evaluated structured, direct, and open-ended prompts using a deep learning example.
- Designed a hypothetical experiment comparing:
  1. Group A: Used ChatGPT.
  2. Group B: Used general internet resources.
  3. Group C: Had no external assistance.

## Results
- ChatGPT was the most effective for clarity and depth with structured prompts.
- Hypothetical group results:
  - Group A: 80% accuracy.
  - Group B: 60% accuracy.
  - Group C: 30% accuracy.

## Conclusion
- Structured prompts are critical for extracting the best responses from ChatGPT.
- Future work: Implement the real user test scenario.
